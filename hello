If you want to periodically perform a task (e.g. sending Emails, backing up database, doing regular maintenance, etc.) at specified times and dates, there are two ways to set scheduled tasks:

Method 1: Use our online cron job service that will save you a headache.
Method 2: Use Cron available in Unix/Linux systems.
If you go with method 2, the following generator can help you produce a crontab syntax that you can copy & paste to your crontab file (You can open the file by using command crontab â€“e). Below the generated crontab syntax, a list of run times will be displayed too. The predictions will help you ensure that you set the time and date right.
